# Server Components and Progressive Enhancement

## Core Principles
- Default to Server Components for all components
- Only use Client Components when interactivity is required
- Follow progressive enhancement patterns
- Ensure proper localization
- Must add translations to all locale JSON files inside repository root-level messages folder when using new i18n keys

## Server Components
- Must not include 'use client' directive
- Should use getTranslations from next-intl/server
- Can include Client Components for interactive parts
- Should handle data fetching and initial rendering

## Client Components
- Must have 'use client' directive at the top
- Should use useTranslations from next-intl
- Must handle loading states with isPending
- Must handle updates using a form with server action
- Must have proper ARIA attributes
- Must NOT use fetch() - always use server actions instead

## Server Actions
- Must be in src/app/actions/*.ts files
- Must have 'use server' directive
- Must use ActionState type
- Must use Zod for validation
- Must revalidate affected paths
- Must use requireAuth for protected actions

## Form Handling
- Must use useActionState hook 
- Must use form action prop
- Must handle loading states
- Must display error messages
- Must be accessible

## Storybook Stories
- Must create a .stories.tsx file for each component
- Must include at least two stories: Empty and WithData states
- Must use async play functions for testing
- Must mock authentication using requireAuth.mockResolvedValue
- Must test both UI elements and interactions
- Must verify accessibility attributes
- Must test data loading states
- Must use within() from @storybook/test for element queries
- Must use expect() for assertions
- Must clean up test data after stories
