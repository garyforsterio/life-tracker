# Server Components and Progressive Enhancement

## Core Principles
- Default to Server Components for all components
- Only use Client Components when interactivity is required
- Follow progressive enhancement patterns
- Ensure proper localization

## Server Components
- Must not include 'use client' directive
- Should use getTranslations from next-intl/server
- Can include Client Components for interactive parts
- Should handle data fetching and initial rendering

## Client Components
- Must have 'use client' directive at the top
- Should use useTranslations from next-intl
- Must handle loading states with isPending
- Must handle updates using a form with server action
- Must have proper ARIA attributes

## Server Actions
- Must be in src/app/actions/*.ts files
- Must have 'use server' directive
- Must use ActionState type
- Must use Zod for validation
- Must revalidate affected paths
- Must use requireAuth for protected actions

## Form Handling
- Must use useActionState hook 
- Must use form action prop
- Must handle loading states
- Must display error messages
- Must be accessible
